===================

Name for objects
----------------

- **File**: A file is a collection of data stored in one unit, identified by a filename. It can be a text file, binary file, or any other file type.

- **Directory**: A directory is a location for storing files on your computer. Directories are also called folders, and they can contain files or other directories.
  ``Directory`` is used instead of the synonym ``folder``, because the shell commands use the term directory (e.g. ``mkdir``, ``cd``).

- **Link**: A link is a reference to a file or directory. It can be a hard link or a symbolic link.
  The term ``link`` is used instead of the synonym ``shortcut``, because the shell commands use the term link (e.g. ``ln``).

- **Path**: A path is a string of characters that represents the location of a file or directory. It can be an absolute path or a relative path.
  The ``path`` is used to specify the location of a file or directory in the shell commands (e.g. ``ls``, ``cp``).
